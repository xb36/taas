# TAAS

## What problem does transgram solve
Transgram is targetting small and medium companies that do not want to build or hire an external support department while staying competitive in an ever evolving digital landscape. It focuses on being as effective and user friendly as possible while allowing you to interact with your website visitors via your Telegram messenger application. This way, you can generate business value in the most intuitive way, without the need of learning a new software or even sitting in front of your laptop.

## What is TAAS
"Transgram as a Service" aims at reducing the configuration overhead when self-hosting an instance of the transgram chat widget for your website. It automates most of the setup process by providing an intuitive user interface. Simply configure your transgram instance (chat headline, auto response messages, API token, ...) from a **dedicated content management system**, spin up a new instance with a single click, and **get support** whenever needed.
