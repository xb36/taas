# TAAS

## What problem does transgram solve
Transgram is targetting small and medium companies that do not want to build or hire an external support department. Instead, it focuses on being as effective and user friendly as possible while allowing you to interact with your website visitors via your Telegram messenger application. This way, you can generate business value in the most intuitive way, without the need of learning a new software or sitting in front of your work PC.

## What is TAAS
"Transgram as a Service" aims at reducing the configuration overhead when self-hosting an instance of the transgram chat widget for your website. It automates most of the setup process by providing an intuitive user interface. Simply configure your transgram instance (chat headline, auto response messages, API token, ...) from a **dedicated content management system** and **get support** whenever needed.

## Why you should pre-purchase the product

1. Get access to exclusive features
2. Get 50% off, forever
